ANSWER:
1) Requirement: The procedure and extent of verification should dictate which validation characteristic tests should be included in the protocol (e.g., specificity, LOD, LOQ, precision, accuracy). (Analytical-Procedures-and-Methods-Validation-for-Drugs-and-Biologics.pdf, p11, p11_c3)
2) Requirement: Considerations that may influence what characteristic tests should be in the protocol may depend on situations such as whether specification limits are set tighter than compendial acceptance criteria, or RT.
