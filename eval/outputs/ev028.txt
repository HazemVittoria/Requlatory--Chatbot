3) Requirement: /Head2right There should be no conflict between requirements. (PI 011-3 Recommendation on Computerised Systems.pdf, p15, p15_c1)
4) Requirement: The URS should be a point of reference throughout the validation life cycle. (pe-009-17-gmp-guide-xannexes.pdf, p221, p221_c2)
5) Requirement: Thus, validation should be supplemented by appropriate administrative and physical controls, as wells as training of users. (PI 041-1 Guidance on Data Integrity.pdf, p33, p33_c1)
